# PROMPT:
# The following facts are facts:
# 
# - Columbia College uses a certain program to store narrative and associated quantitative data. The narrative data is just a string.
# - Suddenly, all of the space characters disappeared from all of the narrative data.
# - It took more than a month to restore it.
# - It is much more difficult to replace spaces than it is to remove them.
#
# The following is speculation:
# 
# - The company is probably hard to work for.
# - The company has had a hard time recruiting competent programmers.
# - Either through malice or incompetence one of the programmers removed all the spaces.
# - If it was simple incompetence, a restore from backup should have been possible.
# - The company probably replaced the spaces using human labor.
#
# With this situation in mind, you'll be writing a program that reads a text file (sample.txt), removes all the spaces, and saves it. Please note, if a programmer did this on purpose to our data, it was not ethical or nice. Bonus actions:
# 
# - Do the same for all files in a folder.
# - Do the same for all files in all folders in a folder.
# - Allow the user to select which file to manipulate.
# - Allow the user to specify a character to remove.
# - Write a short statement in the comments or a text file about the ethics of the situation from the point of view of a programmer considering both the accidental and intentional cases.
# - Write a short statement in the comments or a text file outlining steps that a company should take to avoid this type of situation.
